                    After outgrowing its original home, The PIT moved to 123 E 24th Street on December 31, 2010, opening up the PIT Striker & PIT Underground theaters. In 2015 the original PIT theater on W29th St was renamed The PIT Loft and officially became the third theater at The PIT. In February 2021, the PIT announced the closure of its Flatiron location, leaving only The PIT Loft open in Manhattan.</h6>

They performed in the back room of a downstairs bar where their dressing room was a non-working elevator shaft. Waiters would walk through the middle of their scenes (from the back kitchen to the tables) yelling out, “Who ordered wings?”</h6>
